1. What you understood from this task ?
Ans: Create a basic page for techtonic using sematic tags like articles, headers etc.

2. How I implemented ?
Ans: Implemented the article tag for self contained elements, like About or all sub-domain names. Header tag for the main heading in the page. And section tag to seperate the page into different sections. CSS styling method I choose to use grid, since I felt that was easier to flex to implement for in-row alignment. 

3. What I learned ?
Ans: Learned about media tags while searching on google how websites do device to device specific styling. Did not use it here tgh, since felt grid was working fine. Also learnt to choose good coloe palattes so overall vibe of the page is consistent. 

4. What I think is good about my solution ?
Ans: It works in mobile and laptops. The styling looks and feels techy. If animations are added for the buttons it will look really good.

5. Improvements ?
Ans: Feels that animations can be added so the page will look better and more "futuristic". The color choices still feel not so great. The way I strcutured could be improved a little too ig.

6. Any other thoughts that came to your mind while working
Ans: Had to google and check, how to implement gridbox and how to use gradients in background. Enjoyed the task.
