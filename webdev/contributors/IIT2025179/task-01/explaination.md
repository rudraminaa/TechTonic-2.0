1. What I understood from this task
The goal of this task was to create a simple landing page using only HTML and CSS.
It was expected that the page should be clean, structured properly, and responsive on both desktop and mobile screens.
Another important part was to use semantic HTML tags like header, section, and article, and to add at least one meaningful section related to TechTonic.
Overall, the task was more about understanding good practices rather than making something very fancy.

2. How I implemented the solution
I used semantic HTML tags to keep the structure clear and readable.
The header tag is used for the top section with the title, section tags are used to divide content like About and Features, and article is used inside sections to group related content.
For layout, I used Flexbox in the features section because it is easy to understand and works well for arranging items in a row on desktop and stacking them on mobile.
I also added a media query to handle smaller screens so that the layout does not break on mobile devices.
CSS was kept minimal on purpose so that beginners can easily understand and modify it.

3. What I learned from this task
I understood the importance of using semantic HTML instead of just using div everywhere.
I also learned how Flexbox helps in making layouts responsive with very little code.
While working on this task, I realized that planning the structure first makes styling much easier later.

4. What I think is good about my solution
The structure of the page is simple and easy to read.
The code is clean and beginner-friendly, which matches the purpose of TechTonic.
The page works properly on both desktop and mobile screens without needing complex CSS.
Each section is clearly separated, making it easy to add more content in the future.

5. What could be improved or what felt difficult
The design is very basic and could be improved visually with better colors or spacing.
Choosing the right amount of CSS without overdoing it was a bit confusing at first.
With more practice, I could make the layout look better while still keeping it simple.

6. Any other thoughts while working on this task
While doing this task, I realized that even small projects help in understanding real-world workflows.
It also made me more comfortable with writing structured HTML instead of jumping directly into styling.
I think tasks like this are good for building confidence before moving to more complex projects.
