Q. What I understood from this task
This task was about creating a simple landing page section using HTML and CSS. The goal was to understand how semantic HTML tags are used and how a clean layout can be created using CSS Flexbox. 

Q. How I implemented the solution
I created a "Why TechTonic" section using semantic tags like section, header and article. For styling, I used CSS Flexbox to place the cards side by side on desktop screens. I also added a media query to stack the cards vertically on smaller screens for better readability.

Q. What I learned from this task
From this task, I learned how small CSS mistakes can affect the final output and how important correct syntax is. I also understood the practical use of Flexbox and media queries for responsive design.

Q. What is good about my solution
The structure of the HTML is clean and easy to understand. The section is responsive and the layout does not break on smaller screens. The code is simple and readable, which makes it easy to maintain.

Q. What could be improved or what felt difficult
Initially, I faced issues due to small CSS syntax errors like incorrect property names and class mismatches. With more practice, I can improve my styling skills and make the design more visually appealing.

Q. Any other thoughts
This task helped me gain confidence in working with basic HTML and CSS. It was a good hands-on introduction to web development.
