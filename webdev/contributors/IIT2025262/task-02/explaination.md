Q1 What was this task trying to teach you?
This task helped me understand why responsive navbars are important People use websites on mobile and laptop, so the navbar should work properly on all screen sizes.

Q2: How you designed the navbar structure
I used basic HTML to create the navbar. The logo is inside a div and the links are inside a list. This makes the structure simple and easy to manage.

Q3: How responsiveness was handled?
I used CSS media queries for responsiveness. On small screens, the navigation links are hidden and a hamburger icon is shown. On large screens, the links are visible normally.

Q4: How JavaScript controls the menu?
JavaScript is used to show and hide the menu. When the hamburger icon is clicked, a class is toggled on the nav links. This helps in opening and closing the menu on mobile.

Q5: What you learned from this task?
I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.

Q6: What you think is good and what could be improved?
The navbar works correctly on both mobile and desktop. The animations and design could be improved.

Q7: Any difficulties or thoughts you had while working?
At first, JavaScript was confusing for me. After practicing step by step, I understood how the hamburger menu works.
