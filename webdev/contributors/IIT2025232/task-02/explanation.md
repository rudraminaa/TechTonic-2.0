## Explain What This Code Does

1.  **What this task was trying to teach you**  
    (Why responsive navbars are important in real websites)
    Responsive design is very important as it is the way by which the website is available on all sorts of devices.
2.  **How you designed the navbar structure**  
    (HTML structure and why you chose it)
    obviously started with a nav tag then inside that a complete navbar container div which has the button as well as the ul (This is just so all the everything stays at the same place)
3.  **How responsiveness was handled**  
    (Media queries, breakpoints, desktop vs mobile logic)
    I have a media query for devices with max-width 880px as well as devices with max-width 480px so as to handle both the scenarios
4.  **How JavaScript controls the menu**  
    (What happens when the hamburger icon is clicked)
    Javascript controls the toggle which is when the menu is either on or off for this we use an eventlistener when it is clicked the menu adopts the stylinig of the active class in css
5.  **What you learned from this task**  
    (New concepts, mistakes, or realizations)
    learned how to use emmets, media-queries properly as well as javascript implementation, also learnt what are event listeners
6.  **What you think is good and what could be improved**  
    (Code clarity, responsiveness, UX, etc.)
    Mostly i would like to improve on how the code is structured as that got really confusing for me
7.  **Any difficulties or thoughts you had while working**
    How to remember which tag does what like every time I want to do something there is a new tag for that, how do I remember everything and I made this by watching a tutorial and then remaking it on my own but now I feel I made exactly what the tutorial did - How do I design it completely on my own
    Also, How are the widths, the heights and padding hardcoded that is very hard to understand
