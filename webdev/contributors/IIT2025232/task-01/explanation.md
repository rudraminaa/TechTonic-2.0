**The Goal**
To create a very simple landing page about techtonic using only basic HTML and CSS and No additional Libraries.

**The Implementation**

- I have created a landing page using only HTML and CSS.
- I have used Semantic Tags as mentioned in the issues.
- I have used Flexbox to make responsive design, using the media rule i have changed the flexbox direction to column when it reaches a certain width so as to make it friendly for smaller devices.
- I have used classes to apply css styles to multiple elements at once.

**The learning**

- How to create responsive webpages using flexbox.
- How to use classes effectively to write better code.
- How semantic tags help to create well defined webpages for the programmer as wellass the search engine.

**The Difficulties**
The hardcoding of the border widths.
Understanding flexbox properly.
I have made things work but i don't think i have been able to fully understand how layouting and grids work.

**Thoughts**
I was thinking how if you have to make basic static page websites or landing pages you are better off using tools like Canva or figma instead of investing so much time in HTML + CSS. But obviously for more useful and complex projects these two are the building blocks.
