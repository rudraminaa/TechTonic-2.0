# What you understood from this task
    (What was the goal? What was expected from you?)

# How you implemented the solution
for html
- Made index.html by looking at some examples. 
- started with the navigation bar and added the links to the sections using <nav> and <a> tags.
- used <div> tags to group the content 
- used <article> tags to group the content
- used <header> tags to contain the headings
- used <p> tags to contain the paragraphs
This is the general structure of the index.html file:
```html
<section>
    <div>
        <header>
            <h2></h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <h3></h3>
            <p></p>
        </article>
    </div>
</section>
```
for css
- used the <div>, <nav>, <header>, <article> made in the html file to style the sections
- added a hover effect to the links in the navigation bar to make it feel responsive 
- Learned how to apply a gradient and implemented that 


# What you learned from this task

- Applying a gradient and hover effect
- <nav> tag and making a navigation bar appear pretty
- learning a lot of css properties.


# What you think is good about your solution
- Really proud of implementing the gradient and hover effect
- Only done very little css before so this was fun. 

# What could be improved or what felt difficult
- Dark mode. I have alread spend way too much time learnig how to make a gradient and hover effect.
- the color scheme. I think it looks bland and boring. I mostly added the gradient because of that.

# Any other thoughts that came to your mind while working
- I dont quite get how to use the differnt html tags 
- there are so many css properties, I dont think I can any of them, I proably have to look them up again.
- Also for some reason my css wasnt loading. I tested it with firefox by directly loading the stylesheet, but just opening the index.html file in firefox didnt work. I dont know why.
