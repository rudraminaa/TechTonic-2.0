## Explain What This Code Does




# What this task was trying to teach you
I dont think I have ever seen a webiste that doesnt have a navbar/hamburger menu.
so making a simple one is a good 
# How you designed the navbar structure
the navbar is just a unordered list with a few links wrapped in a nav tag. wrapped in a header tag and div to make it responsive later using css and js

# How responsiveness was handled
786px breakpoint was used to to swich bwtween the nav menu and the hamburger menu(for pc and mobile)
For Desktop: Links show horizontally spaced
For Mobile: Hamburger menu shows and links show vertically spaced
Used js to toggle the hamburger menu
Also added a cool animation to the hamburger menu


# How JavaScript controls the menu
This is rather simple. When the hamburger menu is clicked, js add an .active class
It auto closes the menu when one of the links is clicked. by removing the .active class


# What you learned from this task
how to make a hamburger menu and a simple responsive behaviour
learn how to make a simple animation

# What you think is good and what could be improved
The hamburger menu should close when the use clicks outside of it.
It can do with a more animation and maybe have a dropdown menu instead of sliding it out
the whole color scheme is just bland black and white

# Any difficulties or thoughts you had while working
I had trouble testing as only html was loaded by the browser. For some reason the css and js wasnt loaded.
I decided to use firefox dev console to inject the css and js, to test it. That worked
